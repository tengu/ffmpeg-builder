ffmpeg-builder
==============

Make building ffmpeg and its dependencies a little less painful.

This will not work out of the box for everybody, but it's highly customizable.
Hopefully it will be useful as a starting point for building ffmpeg and 
making it reproducible.

* usage

     make 

     sudo make install

### todo
* extract versions in config.mk
* refactor common targets
